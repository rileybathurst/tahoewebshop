## Design

Primary design elements through a scroll snapping 90vh grid with gradient backgrounds, this let's the viewer know theres something more coming.
Each page has a 3x3 grid with some vertical text elements in the margins.

## Build

Built on a pretty base version of gatsby, keep it simple and fast.
This doesn't work as an offline build as the static image are coming direct from AWS I don't know how to put them behind a ? as I can with a graphQL query

## Variable Fonts

Working with Josefin Sans Variable through fontsource to explore variable fonts
